In the [Get Started](/docs) chapter, we saw that many layers composes the Symfony Boilerplate:

1. Application Layer.
2. Data Layer. 
3. Additional Services.

In remote environments, it is often not the developers that manage the last two layers. 
If that's the case, it would be best to externalize those services to the equivalents from your provider.

In this chapter, we focus on how to deliver properly the first layer.
