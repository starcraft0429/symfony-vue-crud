In the API, a list means retrieving data from the database according to:

* Random filters (e.g., free search).
* Predictable filters (e.g., enum values).
* A sort direction on a field.
* A limit and an offset.

On the web application, a list means displaying data according to user's inputs.

In the next chapters, we explain how it works and how you should implement it.
