We built the web application with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org).

The web application is the frontend of the boilerplate.

While you may find most of the information in the [official documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/installation),
it is essential to note that:

* Most of the logic (use cases, validations, access control) occurs in the API.
* The web application's primary goal is literally to be a UI for the API.
