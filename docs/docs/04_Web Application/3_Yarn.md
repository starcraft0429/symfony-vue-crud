:::note

ðŸ“£&nbsp;&nbsp;All commands have to be run in the `webapp` service (`make webapp`).

:::

We recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as package manager.

When installing a JavaScript dependency, ask yourself if it is a `dev` dependency or not:

```
yarn add [package] [--dev]
```

As we're using Nuxt.js, make sure to choose the package with Nuxt.js support (aka module) if available.

## Hot Reloading
    
In your development environment, the `webapp` service run the command `yarn dev`. 

This command watch for file changes, recompile those files and automatically refresh your browser.

This command may also show ESLint errors and warnings; you can fix them using `yarn lint:fix`.

:::note

ðŸ“£&nbsp;&nbsp;You may also configure your IDE to fix the ESLint errors automatically.
